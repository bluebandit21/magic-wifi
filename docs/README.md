# Magic WiFi

### An ethernet faking WiFi and LoRa host for data transfer without signal.

Magic WiFi is a service built by students interested in farming data in limited connection areas and looking for a low cost method
to collect data without satellites.
It also lines up well to work in racing events, such as Baja racing where crews are limited but may need data from the vehicle while in operation so that
maintenance can be planned for next resupply.

## Overview

The basis of Magic WiFi is that two devices will hook up to an ethernet connection. When the devices think they are connected over ethernet they are actually connected over a WiFi or LoRa wireless connection, depending on range.
